Q1. Frontend is all the software used to interact with a user. In today's age, a frontend is typically a web page or the interface of app, which presents a very complex software system using a simple and easy to use (ideally) interface. Most frontends allow users to interact with them by clicking on colorful buttons, writing text into neat little boxes on screen, select items from a list, etc. which obfuscates the real complexity of the system that is running underneath.
The backend is that said system. It is where most of the logic and computations occur. The frontend is mostly an interface to gather data from a user that is needed to run whatever application, but the running itself happens in the backend.
A good example of a frontend/backend combination is an online banking application, either via the bank's website or as a mobile app, as it happens more than often nowadays. The frontend is all the software that puts all the pretty colors, banners and buttons you use to login into your personal session and also displays whatever information you're after - account balance, transfer list, payments, etc. - in a easy to read and navigate fashion. The backend does all the nasty stuff on the "background", like running cryptographic algorithms to validate your personal info, processing biometric data if that is what you use to login, access the relevant databases and retrieve the info you have requested, etc, upon request from the frontend and replies with just the data requested by the frontend.
A good analogy to this system is a typical U.S pharmacy (the European ones are slightly different). When you go to one to get a prescription filled, the person that receives the doctor's prescription is the frontend. You as a client only interact with this person. Once he/she understands what your request is, he/she goes into the back and asks the pharmacist there to prepare your medicine. While the guy/gal does that, the frontend person can deal with other clients, which is exactly what happens with software frontends (if whatever you've asked takes a while to compute, the frontend leaves you waiting and moves to another client until your request is ready, just like the pharmacy) and once he/she gets word from the backend about your order, he/she goes into the back to fetch your medicine (online you also never interact with the backend) and finishes the request by handing it to you. In this example, the frontend is the pharmacy counter and whomever is taking requests, while the backend is the lab in the back where the medicine is actually prepared.

Q2. Is in the name: global styles apply to all modules in the project where it is defined, while modular styling is limited to the module that it respects to. For example, if you have a website with 10 possible screens, while 9 are to be set with an orange banner and a gray background, while the remaining one needs a purple banner and a black background, the easiest way to achieve this is to set two styles: a global one with the orange banner and gray background and a modular one with the purple and black, ensuring that this modular one only applies to the page in question. Everything else defaults to the global style.
