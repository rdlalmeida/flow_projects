In other words, only contract function are allowed to create resources.

        That said, by restricting both the Ballot creation function and the function to create the ballotPrinter (but not the Printer resource because I can't). This means that only the contract deployer account can run both the Printer creation and the Ballot printing.

        NOTE: Initially I was trying to pass an [UInt64] as the "options" parameter, but Flow does not like this at all, like the whole thing crashes out of nowhere if you try to pass any array as a constructor argument in flow.json. I mean, it's like "warn the developers Please" kinda crash, without even indicating exactly where the thing is crashing into. It took me too long to figure out that it was the input argument in the contract constructor that was creating all these problems in my deploys.
        While I wait for a proper solution (I'm assuming the Flow developers are on the issue after so many crash reports from my end), I need to be creative and find a way to pass an array as a String, given that String arguments are the only ones 100% working right now.
        The options array is read from the .env file as a String and internally it is decomposed into an array using the 'split' function from the String type. Not elegant nor ideal but it is all I can do for now...
