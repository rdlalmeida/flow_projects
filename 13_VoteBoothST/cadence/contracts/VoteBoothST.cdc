/*
    This contract is just a cleaner, more efficient (and hopefully functional) version of the VoteBooth contract. As usual, I've wrote 98% of the last attempt at this contract in one sitting, hoping that by taking care of all the issues revealed by VS code would be enough. After wasting weeks writing a smart contract with almost 1000 lines (a lot of those are these very long comments I'm so prone to write), I found out that my stupid v.12 contract does everything... except storing Ballots in VoteBoxes!!! Which is, like, one of the most import steps of this process!

    I did try to debug this thing for a while, but it is just too much... My best approach is to re-write this thing from scratch and test it thoroughly as much as possible, just to make sure that this contract continues working as supposed.

    Okey, since I added a whole security layer around the minting and burning of Ballots (through the OwnerControl), I now have a problem: how can voter burn a Ballot in his/her VoteBox, without Admin access to a BallotPrinterAdmin, and while maintaining data consistency in the OwnerControl resource, given that, obviously, they don't have access to this resource?
    The solution is to create a (sort of) another Collection, but one without a withdraw function. This collection, which I'm calling BurnBox, to keep things consistent, can be used by any voter that wishes to burn their Ballot. Ballots deposited in this box have no other "exit" other than getting burned because... I'm writing it as so! Man, you gotta love blockchain and smart contracts. No other technology allows me this kind of control! Even if the deployer "forgets" to burn the Ballots in this box (unless I can came up with some sort of periodic burn function of sorts), there's no way to retrieve a Ballot that went into this box. Either they get burned or they stay in there forever.

/*
    To protect the most sensible functions of the BallotPrinterAdmin resource, namely the printBallot function, I'm protecting it with a custom 'Admin' entitlement defined at the contract level.
    This means that, in order to have the 'printBallot' and 'sot' available in a &BallotPrinterAdmin, I need an authorized reference instead of a normal one.
    Authorized references are indicated with a 'auth(VoteBoothST.Admin) &VoteBoothST.BallotPrinterAdmin' and these can only be successfully obtained from the
    'account.storage.borrow<auth(VoteBoothST.Admin) &VoteBoothST.BallotPrinterAdmin>(PATH)', instead of the usual 'account.capabilities.borrow...'
    Because I now need to access the 'storage' subset of the Flow API, I necessarily need to obtain this reference from the transaction signer and no one else! The transaction need to be signed by the deployed to work! Cool, that's exactly what I want!
    It is now impossible to call the 'printBallot' function from a reference obtained by the usual, capability-based reference retrievable by a simple account reference, namely, from 'let account: &Account = getAccount(accountAddress)'

    NOTE: VERY IMPORTANT
    This resource can only be used as a reference, never directly as a resource!!
    In other words, never load this, use it, and then put it back into storage. Because, not only it is extremely inefficient from the blockchain point of view, but most importantly, the resource is dangling and, as such, the self.owner!.address is going to break this due to the fact that self.owner == nil! This resource relies A LOT in knowing who the owner of the resource is (mostly because of the OwnerControl resource), so one more reason to avoid this.
