// NOTE: This stupid, stupid transaction crashes by no apparent reason when run in the normal emulator. But, if run as a test, it works fine! Go figure... The Flow dudes need to fix the CLI ASAP!

// LOL! This is actually working as it is supposed to!! The objective with setting the 'set' and 'remove' functions from the OwnerControl resource is to prevent these from being executed from outside of the account (hence why I created those with access(account)), i.e., these can only be executed from within other resources stored in the same account (such as from within the BallotPrinterAdmin resource), which is the contract deployer (Admin) account! I should NOT be able to directly execute these functions from outside of the account, such as this transaction for instance, hence why it is complaining about it!!! As it should! This shit is actually working as I want it to!!
