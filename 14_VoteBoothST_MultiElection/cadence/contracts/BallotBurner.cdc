/**
    Okey, since I added a whole security layer around minting and burning Ballots, I now have a problem. A small one, but a problem nonetheless: how can a voter burn a Ballot in his/her VoteBox, or from an Election for that matter, without having the Admin access to a BallotPrinterAdmin?
    The solution is to create another resource with deposit only capabilities, sort of a "black box" to where Ballots can only get in but cannot get out. This resource, which I'm calling BurnBox, to keep things consistent. This BurnBox can be accessed by everyone through a public reference, and used to burn Ballots, albeit in a delayed fashion. Ballots deposited in this box have no other "exit" other than getting burned because... I'm writing this thing as such. You gotta love blockchain and smart contracts! No other technology allows me this kind of precise control! Even in the deployer "forgets" to burn the Ballots in this box, there's no way to retrieve a Ballot that was deposited into a BurnBox. Ballots that go inside one either get burned or stay in there forever.
