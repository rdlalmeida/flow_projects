/** 
    ## The Ballot Token standard

    This interface regulates the main resource to use in this voting system, namely, the Ballot. This interface allows independent contract to use this resource.

    Ballots are associated to Election resources, which are to be defined in a different contract. Ballots connect to an Election resource through an electionId that uniquely identifies an Election resource.

        /// I've been debating this parameter more than any other. On one end, I want to "lock" a Ballot to a single owner that either cast this Ballot or burns it. The easy approach to this is to keep an internal parameter with this value in the Ballot. But this leads to the other end, where I want this Ballot to remain as anonymous as possible, and keeping a parameter such as the address of the owner in it may invalidate this. But only if someone else is able to access it. I've decided that the small risk and the negligible loss of voter privacy (all one gets accessing this parameter is the voter address and nothing else about him/her) is worth it because not having this parameter is far more riskier than having it (it raises the small probability that someone else rather than the original owner can cast this ballot)
