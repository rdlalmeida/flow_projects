/**
    I'm killing two birds with one stone with this one. I came to the conclusion that the best approach for this system is not to have one contract per election (which would require deploying a new contract whenever a new election was needed, which would defeat the purpose of this system in the first place) but to have a easy way to create multiple elections with only one contract, like in a function or something of the sort. The obvious solution? To abstract elections as resources! It is surprising to see how useful linear types and resources are, especially in this context. Anyway, need requires a profound modification of the current contract. But since I'm moving in this direction, might as well take the opportunity to do the other thing that I wanted to do, which was to remove the NonFungibleToken standard requirement. No disrespect to Flow (on the contrary actually), but the NFT standard is actually making this worse than it needs to be. I mean, the standard was created to regulate digital collectibles, which is similar to what I want to do, but not quite enough for it to be useful to me. I now know enough of Cadence to make my own standards (which I will at some point...) as well as do this without one. So, lets roll the sleeves and get cracking...

    To protect the most sensible functions of the BallotPrinterAdmin resource, namely the printBallot function, I'm protecting it with a custom 'BoothAdmin' entitlement defined at the contract level.
    This means that, in order to have the 'printBallot' and 'sot' available in a &BallotPrinterAdmin, I need an authorized reference instead of a normal one.
    Authorized references are indicated with a 'auth(VoteBooth.BoothAdmin) &VoteBooth.BallotPrinterAdmin' and these can only be successfully obtained from the 'account.storage.borrow<auth(VoteBooth.BoothAdmin) &VoteBooth.BallotPrinterAdmin>(PATH)', instead of the usual 'account.capabilities.borrow...'
    Because I now need to access the 'storage' subset of the Flow API, I necessarily need to obtain this reference from the transaction signer and no one else! The transaction need to be signed by the deployed to work! Cool, that's exactly what I want!
    It is now impossible to call the 'printBallot' function from a reference obtained by the usual, capability-based reference retrievable by a simple account reference, namely, from 'let account: &Account = getAccount(accountAddress)'

    NOTE: VERY IMPORTANT
    This resource can only be used as a reference, never directly as a resource!!
    In other words, never load this, use it, and then put it back into storage. Because, not only it is extremely inefficient from the blockchain point of view, but most importantly, the resource is "dangling" and, as such, the self.owner!.address is going to break this due to the fact that self.owner == nil! This resource relies A LOT in knowing who the owner of the resource is, so one more reason to avoid this.

/*
    SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE: I want to define this contract to accept a [UInt64] as a election_options argument (which is used to directly set the self._options parameter) but stupid flow-cli does not accept [UInt64] in any freaking capacity! Weirder, I have no problems in doing this is a test file with the Test.deployContract (check the test files. I've commented the deployments with this function where I can provide this array as argument). But since I'm unable to do this with flow.json and the "flow project deploy" or "flow accounts add-contract" commands, I have only two choices from here:
    1 - I need to switch the electionOptions argument to a String, provide something like "1;2;3;4" and then internally parse this to a [UInt64] - NOT IDEAL
    2 - I omit this argument from the constructor altogether and hard-code it in the contract. I do this by accepting a UInt64 argument as electionOptions instead, which should be the number of options available, and construct the [UInt64] internally using the InclusiveRange thing
    This is the current option I'm using because it has the least amount of headaches.

    I've opened a ticket with the Flow people to inform them about this issue. I'm unable to provide the damn [UInt64] in the deployments section of the flow.json. If I add an element such as 
    {
        "type": "Array",
        "value": [
            {
                "type": "UInt64",
                "value": "1"
            },
            {
                "type": "UInt64",
                "value": "2"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
    the trick is to find <something> that flow-cli accepts. I've tried all combinations and then some and the thing just doesn't want any of that. It always complains of "expected JSON array, got..." and then a litany of things other than the ones I'm trying to do.
    This is clearly an issue with the JSON-Cadence parser and I would not be surprised if I was the first one to get it. Anyway, if this gets resolved sometime, I need to redo this constructor at some point.

    NOTE: Turns out the Flow developer dudes took my ticket seriously and did fixed the damn thing! I shouldn't be surprised, but I am. And it didn't took a whole year! Actually, it was surprisingly quick. Anyways, flow-cli released a new version (v2.2.10 @ 18/04/2025) and contract constructors accept arrays as arguments now! I've tested with an ExampleNFTContract and it works like a charm! I'm keeping this note here just to remind me that, sometimes, things do work out!
