            This field is used by the Election resource as the key for the internal dictionary where Ballots are stored
            As such, this field needs to be unique and also prevent information leakage to the voter. An obvious choice
            would be the voter's address, since it is a unique element by default, but that raises some privacy issues, since
            there a link somewhere between an address and a Ballot and that's a no no. So, I'm going a level deep and store the
            hash digest of the voter's address in this field and use it as a sort of "private identification string" that is
            also unique, under the assumption that the hash algorithm used is collision resistant to a degree.
            This makes sure that multiple Ballots by the same voter have the same ballotIndex, in principle that is.

            This is the field where the choice in the ballot gets reflected. The idea is to have an encrypted value here, hence why I set it as a String.
            What gets encrypted is still open to debate, My idea was to simplify this and just put a number in this field to make counting easier, but once I add an encryption layer, this strategy limits my cipher space quite a lot. But if I concatenate it with a very large random integer tough... Anyway, this needs some thinking, but the idea is to have the frontend setting this field so that the encryption process happens off-chain.
