/**
    ## The VoteBox Resource standard

    The interface that regulates the VoteBox resource and usage. VoteBoxes are resources that give to a voter their ability to interact with this application using the methods exposed by this resource. As it has been the case so far, I'm using Interfaces to establish standards for every resource implemented in this process.
