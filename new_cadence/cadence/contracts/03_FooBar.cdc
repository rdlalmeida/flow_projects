It returns the value inside an optional (the ones with a '?' at the end) if it contains a value, or it panics and aborts the execution if the optional is a 'nil' instead, i.e., doesn't have a value.

                In Cadence, every time we retrieve a Resource or Variable from a Resource's internal structure, such as the ownedNFTs dictionary, that value is always an optional to safeguard the possibility of the Resource had been moved somewhere else before. This is standard, so in every case we need to deal with the possibility of a 'nil' being returned instead. This starts by defining the returns type as an optional (by appending a '?' to the return type) and then do some testing, force-cast or force unwrap to get rid of that optional.
