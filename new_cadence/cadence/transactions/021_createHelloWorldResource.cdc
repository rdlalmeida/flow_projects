    // Good programming practices suggest defining non-initialized transaction-wide variables. These
    // variables are accessible in both the prepare and execute phases.

    // transaction signer

    // informative in the execute phase.

    /*
        The prepare phase is the where the transaction has access to the Authorization Account, i.e., an abstraction of the account that signed this transaction (an object of type 'AuthAccount'). This step used to be quite sensible and made transactions problematic because of oversized control over the signer account, which could be used to transfer assets to a malicious actor for example. The Crescendo upgrade adds new layers of security by, for example, limiting the prepare phase to certain actions, such as 'SaveValue', which limits the transaction to solely save objects into the signing account, thus preventing unwanted transfers or deletions of stored digital objects.

        NOTE: The flow-cli is still using the 'old' interpreter and doesn't want anything with the new signature for accessing an AuthAccount in the prepare phase:
            
            prepare(signer: auth(SaveValue) &Account)

        This new signature allows for more secure transactions due to the increased granularity of access controls, namely the auth(SaveValue) which limits this transaction to save stuff into the signer's account and nothing else. This makes transaction analysis way more simpler since we don't need (in principle) to check every line. I can be sure, by this entitlement alone, that this transaction is not going to empty the user storage for example (can we be 100% sure with these entitlements alone?)
